So a new requirement is on the cohort generation part but the requirement basically is that we have multiple students in a school and each student has a different education level now we want a cohort algorithm by which we will firstly conduct base assessment of students after conducting the baseless assessments we will have different students let us say 200 students of different educational levels now in the cohort generation what we want is we want students according I mean it can be variable we can either have students according to their educational levels or we can have them by let us there are two things in my mind What if we firstly teach the students which are low performing I mean the students whose base assessment level is lower the sale assessment level 1 234 et cetera we teach them first or we teach the students with high based adjustment level because they already know too much and we just need to teach them a little so they will be you know done from our course why I am telling this because let us say in real world we have only one tutor per school in rival implementation a single tutor cannot teach eight cohorts of 200 students in just five periods every day we have five periods and we have 4 hours for that we teach each cohort for 50 minutes so let us say we have eight cohorts but the teaching capacity is only of five cohorts what about the three other cohort students if we do it sequentially I mean teaching the 5 cohorts and keeping the 3 until we complete the first 5 cohorts it can take three to four months What this will do is it will create discrepancy like five cohort students will be taught already and three won't be this is not nice so a solution which I have in my mind is to categorize students if they know too much teach them first and let them go Or teach the students who know a lot of things and then focus on the remaining ones By doing this what we will do is we will let us say we have 8 cohorts but now we have categorized them according to the educational levels Then we teach the first five cohorts of students they know some things like level like cohort number one has level one level 9 students we teach them level sorry cohort 2 has students of level 8 accordingly so we need five such cohorts in rest of the students are kept in a list after these five cohorts are completed we will have a list of PVS students now the case is that some students may leave some students may you know get taught somewhere else and they are not needed to be assessed on our platform So what we will do is we will assess 5 cohorts and we will keep the 3 there only but we won't do anything with them After competition we will take the SI in again and we will we will take baseline again and then we will proceed So what do you think about this
